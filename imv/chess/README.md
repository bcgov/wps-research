## Synthetic multispectral "chessboard" data
* Synthetic multispectral data generated by https://github.com/bcgov/bcws-psu-research/blob/master/py/raster_synthetic_data.py
* includes spectral noise, and one-hot encoded class bands which include some spatial overlap (the class bands were removed for the semi-supervised classification session below..)

### Files
* stack.bin: the image data
* stack.hdr: image header incl. dimensions
* stack.bin_targets.csv: targets selected by manual annotation using imv (delete this to try from scratch)..
