Usage:
  gpt <op>|<graph-file> [options] [<source-file-1> <source-file-2> ...]

Description:
  This tool is used to execute SNAP raster data operators in batch-mode. The
  operators can be used stand-alone or combined as a directed acyclic graph
  (DAG). Processing graphs are represented using XML. More info about
  processing graphs, the operator API, and the graph XML format can be found
  in the SNAP documentation.

Arguments:
  <op>               Name of an operator. See below for the list of <op>s.
  <graph-file>       Operator graph file (XML format).
  <source-file-i>    The <i>th source product file. The actual number of source
                     file arguments is specified by <op>. May be optional for
                     operators which use the -S option.

Options:
  -h                 Displays command usage. If <op> is given, the specific
                     operator usage is displayed.
  -e                 Displays more detailed error messages. Displays a stack
                     trace, if an exception occurs.
  -t <file>          The target file. Default value is 'target.dim'.
  -f <format>        Output file format, e.g. 'GeoTIFF', 'HDF5',
                     'BEAM-DIMAP'. If not specified, format will be derived
                     from the target filename extension, if any, otherwise the
                     default format is 'BEAM-DIMAP'. Ony used, if the graph
                     in <graph-file> does not specify its own 'Write'
                     operator.
  -p <file>          A (Java Properties) file containing processing parameters
                     in the form <name>=<value> or a XML file containing a
                     parameter DOM for the operator. Entries in this file are
                     overwritten by the -P<name>=<value> command-line option
                     (see below). The following variables are substituted in
                     the parameters file:
                         ${system.<java-sys-property>}
                         ${operatorName} (given by the <op> argument)
                         ${graphFile} (given by the <graph-file> argument)
                         ${targetFile} (pull path given by the -t option)
                         ${targetDir} (derived from -t option)
                         ${targetName} (derived from -t option)
                         ${targetBaseName} (derived from -t option)
                         ${targetFormat} (given by the -f option)
  -c <cache-size>    Sets the tile cache size in bytes. Value can be suffixed
                     with 'K', 'M' and 'G'. Must be less than maximum
                     available heap space. If equal to or less than zero, tile
                     caching will be completely disabled. The default tile
                     cache size is '34,359,738,368M'.
  -q <parallelism>   Sets the maximum parallelism used for the computation,
                     i.e. the maximum number of parallel (native) threads.
                     The default parallelism is '16'.
  -x                 Clears the internal tile cache after writing a complete
                     row of tiles to the target product file. This option may
                     be useful if you run into memory problems.
  -S<source>=<file>  Defines a source product. <source> is specified by the
                     operator or the graph. In an XML graph, all occurrences of
                     ${<source>} will be replaced with references to a source
                     product located at <file>.
  -P<name>=<value>   Defines a processing parameter, <name> is specific for the
                     used operator or graph. In an XML graph, all occurrences
                     of ${<name>} will be replaced with <value>. Overwrites
                     parameter values specified by the '-p' option.
  -D<name>=<value>   Defines a system property for this invocation.
  -v <dir>           A directory containing any number of Velocity templates.
                     Each template generates a text output file along with the
                     target product. This feature has been added to support a
                     flexible generation of metadata files.
                     See http://velocity.apache.org/ and option -m.
  -m <file>          A (Java Properties) file containing (constant) metadata
                     in the form <name>=<value> or any XML file. Its primary 
                     usage is to provide an additional context to be used
                     from within the Velocity templates. See option -v.
  --diag             Displays version and diagnostic information.
