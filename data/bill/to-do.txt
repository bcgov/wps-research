ACHIEVED:

    TSNE to embed to 2D for visualization.
    
    HDBSCAN for clustering

    dNBR is definitely important.


NOT YET:

    HDBSCAN cannot tell which cluster is burn.

    HDBSCAN hyperparameter is not great if staying the same, needs to change.


WHAT's NEXT?

    FIND a method to select hyperparameter for HDBSCAN automatically.


WHAT IS IN ACTION:

    WE DONT KNOW ABOUT THE RATIO of burn-unburn. WE SAMPLE A NUMBER OF POINTS and CLUSTER.

    ASSIGNING BURN-unburn -> Simple use dnbr (means of all in cluster) which higher -> burned!

    BUT to have it accurate, we need an accurate mapping (no label) first.

    1. Needs to know which band combination to use (features).


BALANCING ISSUE;

    No in/out balancing is needed. Since it just makes sense for when most pixels inside the polygon
is filled. But before that, if using polygon as criteria of inside, most of them are not even burned yet.

-> Decision: Remove it from GUI Visualization, colour can later be coded from 'true classification'

UPDATE GUI:

    From band list, select 3 bands for visualization (3 slot to enter number, default of 0)

    On top of TSNE: Selection of turning colour on.


GIT REVERT (once in a while): GO BACK TO 'up notebook' HASH and git pull to pull all updates.




TODAY:

    1. put red blue back
    2. add 3rd plot
