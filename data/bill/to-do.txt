Tasks: Cloud masking

1. use QGIS to see what cloud probability really looks like.

2. Write algo to extract cloud probability.

3. Cloud Analysis.

    For close dates, see:
    
    + At non-cloud mask: would signal fluctuates a lot?
    + At cloud-mask: how would signal changes.

Compare across different cloud probability, can we learn an enhancement rule?

E.g: At this cloud probability = 0.7, snow prob = 0.1, ... SWIR = 5000 (high) -> model -> 2340.


Idea:

Sometimes cloud masking is too much, where thin cloud, haze, fog, ... we can actually still see through but the masking
marks it as no Data. 

Unless we cannot see nothing anymore (complete white), that part can be marked as no data. 

Otherwise, if it's blurred, but visible, we can use spatial reasoning to enhance data at that location,
so that part that has been marked as cloud, still visible will get the quality enhanced, which Level 2 data should have
less no data and masked with enhanced pixel quality.
