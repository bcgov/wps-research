ACHIEVED:

    TSNE to embed to 2D for visualization.
    
    HDBSCAN for clustering

    dNBR is definitely important


WHAT's NEXT?

    Find a method to select hyperparameter for HDBSCAN automatically.


CURRENT TASKS:

    Hint images should always come in as everything but not the border.

    That is good. 

    Sampling done? Use mask to infer
