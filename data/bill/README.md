About Us
---
We are a team at Predictive Services Unit (PSU) working on Data Science projects at BC Wildfire Service. Some projects are very practical, we hope to get them done very early.



High Performance Computing
---
One of our biggest strengths is a High Performance Computer that can run parallel work quickly on many tasks (512 threads).

We also have NVidia GPU infrastructure, where lots of Bill's work is mostly done on.
