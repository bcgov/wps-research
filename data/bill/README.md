<h1>Sentinel 2 Researches</h1>


About Us
---
We are a team at Predictive Services Unit (PSU) working on Data Science projects at BC Wildfire Service. Some projects are very practical, we hope to get them done very early.

+ **Ashlin Richardson** is the Senior Data Scientist, his experiments drive and revitalize these projects.

+ **Bill Co** is a Co-op student, he has been working on this repository and he is very excited for many challenges ahead.

+ Supports and Ideas from many others in the unit (e.g Neal Mcloughlin, Superintendent of the PSU).



High Performance Computing
---
One of our biggest strengths is a High Performance Computer that can run parallel work quickly on many tasks (512 threads).

We also have NVidia GPU infrastructure, where lots of Bill's work is mostly done on.
